Number of principal components that explain at least 90% of the variance: 3
Insights from PCA:
Principal Components:
1. The first principal component captures the overall productivity dynamics.
2. Subsequent components capture variations in overtime and the number of workers.
How to Use Principal Components:
1. Reduce the complexity of analysis.
2. Understand how factors interact and affect actual productivity.
3. Focus on components that explain most of the variance for predictive modeling.
